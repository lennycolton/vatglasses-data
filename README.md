# VATGlasses Data Project
Airport and sector data for the VATGlasses project.

## Wiki
Please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/lennycolton/vatglasses-data/wiki) for information about:
- The Data Format
- Current Data Sets
- Page Assignments
- File Creation Tools

## New Data Sets
As a general rule, you should be local staff, an instructor, or (in small vACCs only) a mentor to add a new region to VATGlasses. This provides a point of contact for all future changes to the region and helps prevent incorrect information from making it onto the platform.

If you're a member of local staff looking to add your local vACC to the platform, feel free to open an issue with your name, vACC staff role, and Discord username. We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

By default, we'll assume that you're happy for you data to be added to this repository. If you'd rather it wasn't open to public contributions, we can keep it in our closed-sourced respository, instead.

**N.B.** Closed-source data is not truly hidden - it is still freely accessible via the API.

## Project Maintainers
From time to time, we may reach out to certain members of the community and ask them to help with maintaining this repository. Their tasks may include (amongst other things): approving changes to the repository, and altering the contents of data files to follow our global standards (consistency in boundaries, naming conventions, ownership structure, etc.).

You are not able to apply to become a VATGlasses maintainer - we will reach out to long-standing members with a proven history of contributing through issues and pull requests.

## Contribution Guide
Feel free to contribute to any of the data sets included in this repository. Please be aware that local vACC staff may perform bulk updates to data sets that they manage. VATGlasses-managed data sets rely on the community to keep them up-to-date and won't see bulk changes like this.

Please ensure that you provide a source for your issues and pull-requests! Issues and pull requests without a valid source will be automatically closed.

By committing changes to this repository, you acknowledge that the copyright ownership of any data committed transfers to Lenny Colton in its entirety.

All data held in this repository is owned by Lenny Colton and is for exclusive use by the VATGlasses project. The data in this repository is not to be used for any other purposes without express, written permission.

**N.B.** Data committed to this repository is immediately deployed to the VATGlasses site - please expect the project collaborators to be picky and test things thoroughly before we approve them!
